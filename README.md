## Description 

This launcher was made because users felt that the OEM launcher did not have enough features. Including basic ones like saving your password for auto-log in features. 

## Setup/Installation 

Setting up should be easy! Go ahead and download the .zip from the repo link above or use the .7z unloader if you have that. Run installation as normal and log in.
